# The Code in Modern Minecraft

An old attempt to remake the minecraft map "The Code" by JesperTheEnd to be playable in Modern Minecraft

This switches out the redstone and spawners in the original with command blocks.

Only Level 1 and 2 are actually playable. When I have the free time, I'll probably complete this.
